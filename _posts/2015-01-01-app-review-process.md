## Pre-Requisites
Developers have signed up for a [Developer account](https://poynt.net/auth/signup/developer).

Developers have an app submitted for review through the [Developer portal](https://poynt.net/terminalapps).

### Step 1:
Developer verifies whether the app follows the general guidelines as described in the [Poynt App Development Guidelines](../appstore/app-development-guidelines.html).

### Step 2:
Should any changes be required, developer updates their app.

### Step 3:
The submission form requires the developer to provide a short application summary, detailed description, change log information, app screenshots and the country of distribution. This information will be used by the app review team and it will be displayed in the app marketplace (“Store”) once the app has been approved.

When the app is created, Poynt generates 2048 bit RSA private key that the developer needs to download to securely communicate with their app. Poynt does not store the private key, so if the developer loses the key the will need to generate a new one on poynt.net.


### Step 4 & 5:
Upon submission, app status changes to “Submitted” in Poynt developer portal.
Once the app is submitted an automated ticket is generated in the Poynt ticketing system. App review team gets notified via email that the app has been submitted for review.

### Step 6:
Poynt app team will request for supporting documents and information:
```
* App support form
* Infrastructure readiness
* Distribution agreement
* In-App billing details(Plan names, descriptions, amounts etc, see step 11.)
* Test credentials(for app review)
* Marketing collateral(Images, write-ups etc for post go-live marketing)
```
### Step 7:
Developer returns completed and signed forms to the Poynt app team via email.


### Step 8:
At this point, the **Poynt App Review Team** is engaged and an app review analyst reviews the submitted app.
During the review, if any app issues are discovered the app gets rejected and would need to be updated for further consideration. The app is placed back in the queue(Step 2) if rejected.
If the app passes all checks, the app moves to the next step in the process.

### Step 9:
If the app passes all the necessary checks, it is signed.

### Step 10:
If the app needs to be run on a select few terminals for sanity checks etc, there could be an optional step to run a pilot test before Go-Live.

### Step 11:
Billing plans can be created under your app within the [App Dashboard](https://poynt.net/mc/#/developer/dashboard). Please follow the [**Billing Best practices**](../appstore/app-billing-best-practices.html) when requesting plans creation and through the app billing lifecycle. Plan information should be requested in the following format (Example below):

```
"name": "Basic plan",
"description": "Basic services plan with 30-day trial",
"country": "US",
"currency": "USD",
"value": 3999
"interval": "MONTH",
"scope": "BUSINESS",
"trialPeriodDays": 30
```

```
Note:
"value" should be in cents
"interval" can have any one of these values "DAY | WEEK | MONTH | YEAR"
"scope" can have any one of these values "BUSINESS | STORE | DEVICE"

```

The Poynt app team creates the plan and will respond with plan information. Sample plan information below:

```
{
    "description": "Basic services plan with 30-day trial",
    "scope": "BUSINESS",
    "createdAt": "2017-08-17T23:10:52.430Z",
    "updatedAt": "2017-08-17T23:10:52.430Z",
    "amounts": [
        {
            "country": "US",
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 3999
        }
    ],
    "interval": "MONTH",
    "trialPeriodDays": 30,
    "amount": 3999,
    "planId": "d6d4894a-84dc-4f29-8d7d-d1e8f6b62b2d",
    "appId": "urn:aid:3f74d6f1-f489-45a0-ba54-3284dc6387bc",
    "status": "INACTIVE",
    "name": "Basic Plan"
}
```

 The developer uses the **planId** to integrate the billing flow in the app by invoking the billing fragment through the SDK. Please see [**Integration with Poynt Billing Services**](../appstore/integrating-with-billing.html) for integration details.

Once the app integration is complete, developer informs the Poynt app team. App team Activates (*"status": "ACTIVE"*) the plan. At this point the plan shows up in the Poynt App Store.

Additional plans can be requested in a similar way or all at once initially.
### Step 12:
The app is set to **LIVE** by the app review analyst. The app shows up on the Poynt app store. Merchants can now find the app and Subscribe to the App's plans(as described in Step 11) by downloading and installing the app on their terminal.

### Step 13:
Poynt Marketing team will reach out to the developer contact for details on setting up webinars, distribution strategy etc.
